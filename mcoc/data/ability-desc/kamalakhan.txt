Passive - Poison Immunity

Passive - Deformation
• As the inexperienced Ms. Marvel gets to know her opponent’s fighting style, she better learns to alter her size and avoid incoming damage, increasing Block Proficiency by 5.5% for each Fury stack active.

Heavy Attacks - Fury
• While charging her Heavy Attack, Ms. Marvel continually gains stacks of Fury, each increasing her Attack by 20% for 10 seconds. These stacks are lost as she is struck during combat.

All Special Attacks
• While Ms. Marvel has 2 or more stacks of Fury, her Special Attacks each remove 2 stacks of her opponent’s Armor Up effects.

Special 1 - Morpho-Punch
• This attack generates up to 4 stacks of Fury, each increasing Attack by 15% for 9 seconds.
• This Special Attack generates a random amount between 1 and 4 stacks of Fury.

Special 2 - Stretchy Cosmic Kick
• 100% chance for Fury, increasing your Attack by 35% for 10 seconds.

Special 3 - Fake Out
• This attack has a 90% chance to grant a permanent Fury effect, increasing Attack by 35%.
• While this effect has an infinite duration, it can still be Nullified.
• This Fury can only be stacked once.

Signature Ability - Morphogenetics
• Ms. Marvel starts to figure out this whole Contest thing, increasing her Fury durations by (2 - 7.5) seconds and increasing the Potency of her Fury effects by 10%.
• The duration increase is a flat amount on top of her existing Fury durations and stacks with Masteries and Nodes
• Potency is the overall strength of Kamala's Fury effects. This number does not scale with Signature Level.

Recommended Masteries
Extended Fury / Enhanced Fury: Kamala Khan is all about the Fury stacks, and enhancing these abilities further will increase her overall damage output but a wide margin.
Liquid Courage: Kamala’s Inhuman genetics grant her immunity to Poison, allowing her to gain the full benefits of Liquid Courage without any of the downsides.
Parry: A good tactic to use with Kamala is to Parry her opponents and then begin charging a Heavy attack to gain the Fury stacks from the attack, getting into a good rhythm with this tactic can keep Kamala’s Fury count high, which grants her more Block Proficiency and Damage.

Strengths
Kamala Khan boasts some extremely high raw damage when under the effect of multiple Fury stacks, granting her high damage output during these windows. Players that can capitalize on this will be able to bring down their opponents quickly.
Kamala also boasts a decent balance between attacking and defending, allowing her to take down tough paths in Alliance Quests, due to her Poison Immunity, strong Fury effects, and her Deformation to keep up her Block Proficiency.

Weaknesses
Kamala Khan is extremely reliant on her Fury stacks to generate both offensive and defensive effects, and as a result, Mystic champions that can strip these effects away will be a tough fight for Kamala.
