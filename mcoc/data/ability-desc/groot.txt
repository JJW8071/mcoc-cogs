Basic Abilities: Pacifism, Cleanse, Regeneration, Bleed Immunity

When Struck by Critical Hits - Pacifism
```• Groot’s gentle nature is put to the test any time the opponent strikes with a Critical Hit or uses a Special Attack against him, with a 100% chance to gain a Pacifism charge. Each time a charge is gained, Groot has a 10% chance per charge to throw off his gentle nature.```
Passive
```• When Groot throws off his gentle nature, he gains one Fury and one Cruelty effect for each Pacifism charge, increasing Attack by 233.94 for 10 seconds.
• Each Cruelty effect increases Groot's Critical Damage Rating by 105.26.```
Passive - Cleanse
```• Unique physiology allows Debuff effects to be shrugged off 55% faster than normal.
• A lack of blood provides full immunity to Bleeding.```

Special 1: I am Groot
Groot shows off his unique plant physiology to grow his limbs into the earth and surprise his foe.
```• This attack pierces 85% of the target's Armor.```
Special 2: I AM GROOT!
Groot isn't a terrible monster. He stomps his foot, then shows off his passive side.
```• Advanced cellular regeneration allows up to 2469.04 Health to be recovered over 6 seconds, based on lost Health.
• This attack is Unblockable.```
Special 3: WE ARE GROOT!
When a gentle giant has had enough, he calls in a familiar furry face to lend a hand. Oh yeah!
```• 100% chance to inflict Bleed, dealing 1058.3 Direct Damage over 3 seconds.```

Recommended Masteries
```Enhanced Fury / Extended Fury: The Attack bonus that Groot gains from his Pacifism counts as a Fury effect. Grabbing these two Masteries allows Groot’s Pacifism to be much stronger and last longer for an overall higher damage output.
Double Edge: As Groot is immune to Bleed effects, he only gains the bonus attack from Double Edge with none of the damage trade off.
Greater Vitality / Perfect Block / Physical Resistance: Groot is a champion that can go the distance in a fight. His inherent Physical Resistance, coupled with the boost he gains from Pacifism can allow him to slug it out much longer than other champions. Additionally, the more triggers of Pacifism that can be gained in a fight, the better as they each represent a large boost of damage output. Increasing Groot’s longevity allows him more chances to trigger Pacifism and more opportunities to get those large damage boosts.```

Strengths
```Groot is a champion that can punish enemies for frequent use of Special Attacks, as he gains Pacifism charges regardless of whether he’s hit or not from the attack.
With his base Physical Resistance, Pacifism, and Regeneration on Special 2, Groot can take a lot of punishment during a fight, while also dishing out lots of damage in large bursts when his Pacifism trigger causes him to snap.
Groot’s ability to shrug off debuffs such as Poison, Stun and Armor Break faster allows him to shut down much of the power from some champions reliant on such effects.```

Weaknesses
```As Groot relies on Pacifism for large bursts of damage, he can be more susceptible than others to the random chance of activations. It is possible, however unlikely, that Groot’s Pacifism won’t trigger during a fight, and he’ll be left sitting with 8 stacks at the end of the encounter.```
