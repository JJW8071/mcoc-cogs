Recommended Masteries
```Precision: As Daredevil’s Stun chance is tied to his Critical Hits, increasing his Critical Hit Chance will result in more Stuns to the enemy, which in turn can be used to create more Armor Break effects.
Willpower: Daredevil’s World on Fire grants him a fairly large Critical Hit Rate boost whenever the opponent places a detrimental effect on him. This works alongside Willpower to ensure that Daredevil becomes a defensive and offensive force to any opponent trying to use detrimental effects.
Stupefy: Increasing the Stun duration for Daredevil can allow for more attacks, which in turn allows for more Armor Breaks, which can cause a massive increase in damage output if used and timed correctly.```

Strengths
```Daredevil has many tools to deal with many types of opponents. If an opponent is shown to have Willpower, a smart player can avoid using Special 1 & 2 in favor of a Special 3, since Special 3 attacks can’t score Critical Hits and therefor can’t Stun.
Consistent Perfect Blocks combined with constant Physical Resistance gives Daredevil a good level of survivability for most fights, in addition to his offensive abilities.
Mixing up attack combos when an opponent is Stunned can increase damage output for further combos and also tear apart enemy Armor Up effects. If an opponent is Stunned, try doing two Medium attacks in a row instead of a standard combo.```

Weaknesses
```As Daredevil’s power comes from his Stun effects, enemies that are immune to Stun (such as various Story Quest bosses) and champions that have the limber mastery can be difficult to deal with.```
