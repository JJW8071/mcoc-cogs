Recommended Masteries
```Precision: As Wolverine’s Cruelty and Bleed effects are both tied to Critical Hits, increasing her Critical Hit Rate via the Precision mastery is extremely important to stack up these effects.
Recovery: Wolverine is very dependent on her Regeneration to keep her alive, as she has very little defense or Armor outside of it. Increasing her Regen Rate will give her longevity for more difficult fights.```

Strengths
```Wolverine boasts one of the highest Critical Hit Rates in the entire Contest, granting her large burst damage and the ability to bypass strong Armor on opponents.
Wolverine’s consistent, powerful Bleed and Cruelty effects allow her to quickly take down enemies in timed fights. X23 is one of the most aggressive champions in the game, allowing her to finish fights quickly when necessary, such as when under the effect of a Bleed or Degeneration node.```

Weaknesses
```Wolverine has small defenses outside of her Regeneration, and as such performs poorly against enemies that can frequently place Heal Blocks.```
