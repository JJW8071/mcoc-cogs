• Critical Hits lacerate opponent’s with a 79% chance, inflicting Bleed damage for 105% of your Attack over 5 seconds.
• Against Naturally Bleed Immune Champions: Wolverine changes her fighting style, gaining Cruelty Buffs in place of her Bleed effects, increasing Critical Damage by 31% for 7.5 seconds.

• 6% increased Critical Hit Chance against Bleeding targets, or while under the effects of a Cruelty Buff

When Struck & When Attacking - Regeneration

Heavy Attacks
• Strikes multiple times. Each hit has an additional 7.5% chance to Critical Hit

Special 1: Arterial Strike

Special 2: Triplicate Slash

Special 3: Finish the Mission

Signature Ability - Frenzy
• Anytime the opponent has 3 or more Bleed stacks or Wolverine has 3 or more Cruelty stacks, her assassin training kicks in, telling her to finish them off, increasing Critical Hit Chance and Critical Damage by (4% - 15%).
• These effects stack with all of Wolverine’s other Critical Boosts, granting her the highest Critical Hit Rate in the game while her signature ability is active.
• This also counts self inflicted Bleed effects, such as Double Edge.

Recommended Masteries
Precision: As Wolverine’s Cruelty and Bleed effects are both tied to Critical Hits, increasing her Critical Hit Rate via the Precision mastery is extremely important to stack up these effects.
Recovery: Wolverine is very dependent on her Regeneration to keep her alive, as she has very little defense or Armor outside of it. Increasing her Regen Rate will give her longevity for more difficult fights.

Strengths
Wolverine boasts one of the highest Critical Hit Rates in the entire Contest, granting her large burst damage and the ability to bypass strong Armor on opponents.
Wolverine’s consistent, powerful Bleed and Cruelty effects allow her to quickly take down enemies in timed fights. X23 is one of the most aggressive champions in the game, allowing her to finish fights quickly when necessary, such as when under the effect of a Bleed or Degeneration node.

Weaknesses
Wolverine has small defenses outside of her Regeneration, and as such performs poorly against enemies that can frequently place Heal Blocks.
