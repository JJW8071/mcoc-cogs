War Machine - originally posted 08-13-2015

James “Rhodey” Rhodes, decorated U.S. Air Force pilot and longtime ally of Tony Stark, combats evil and injustice as the armored War Machine. True to his codename, Rhodes’ armor delivers heavy metal power via its wrist-mounted machine guns and shoulder-mounted artillery cannon.

**Recommended Masteries

Enhanced Fury**
The bonus from this mastery applies to each instance of Fury, so it will apply 12 times when War Machine triggers his Empty the Clip ability

Courage
War Machine receives a massive boost to attack when he’s low on health, and Courage adds more damage on top of that for a massive boost. Additionally, the extra armor keeps him alive longer to extend the time he's in that low-hp "Courage" zone.

Greater Vitality & Block Proficiency
Empty the Clip triggers when War Machine is below 20% health, and having more health and block proficiency allows him to stay in that “sweet spot” longer and get more use out of his abilities before dying.

Pierce
Pierce allows War Machine to more easily defeat heavily Armored champions when combined with his powerful Armor Break effects – this is particularly helpful against targets immune to War Machine's Bleed.

Strengths
War Machine’s frequent Bleed effects from Blast Barrage (Special 1) allow him to deal with Armored champions easily, such as Iron Man, Superior Iron Man, Hulkbuster and Juggernaut.
Armor Break from Shoulder Artillery (Special 2) allows War Machine to also deal with enemies that do not bleed, such as Colossus. Avoiding Blast Barrage in favor of Shoulder Artillery is recommended for opponents that shrug off Bleed effects.

Pairing the burst of Attack from Empty the Clip with a Class Bonus and the high damage of Special 2 or Special 3 can drop regenerating mutant Champions with a quick spike of damage.

Frequent bleed effects and powerful armor breaks make War Machine a more offensive version of the classic Iron Man.

Weaknesses
War Machine deals low base Special damage, relying instead on his Armor Break and Bleed effects to help him amp up his damage output with their stacking effects. This makes him weak to champions that can remove these effects, such as Scarlet Witch or Vision.

War Machine’s Armor Up ability trigger less often than Iron Man’s and is inherently weaker, making him more susceptible to attacks throughout the fight.

Reliance on Armor exposes War Machine to the True Damage and class bonuses wielded by many Cosmic Champions.

Multi-hit special attacks quickly burn through War Machine’s Empty the Clip Armor stacks.
