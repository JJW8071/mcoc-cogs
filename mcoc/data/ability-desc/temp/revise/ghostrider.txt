Recommended Masteries
Parry: Landing a Heavy Attack is paramount to gaining Ghost Rider’s Life Steal effect. Grabbing this Mastery will allow you to Stun your opponent long enough to land a Heavy Attack.
Mystic Dispersion: Ghost Rider’s Fate Seal on Special 1, when timed correctly, can allow him to strip away the opponent’s Buff effects and gain a large burst of power. This can allow him to quickly build up to multiple Judgment effects before hitting the big Damnation to finish the fight.

Strong Match-Ups
Gamora, Drax:  Ghost Rider’s Bleed Immunity and class advantage puts him over these Champions easily.
Kang, Wolverine, Wolverine (X-23):  These Champions rely heavily on their power meter, which Ghost Rider can strip away with his Special 2 Judgment. Additionally, his Damnation power locks and Heal Blocks these Champions, giving him a strong upper hand.
Groot, Black Panther (Civil War), Venom:  These Champions rely on their Buff effects to do well in any given fight. With Ghost Rider’s Fate Seal on his Special 1 Judgment, and Damnation to Fate Seal them, he can lock down these Champions very well.

Weak Match-Ups
Red Hulk, Captain America:  In addition to a class advantage over Ghost Rider, these Champions do not rely on Buff effects for their damage output and are not hit as strongly by Damnation or Fate Seal.
