A wave of power from the Dark Dimension burns through his opponent’s very soul, burning out any sources of power it may find.

Recommended Masteries
```Mystic Dispersion: Dormammu has a Nullify ability on his Special 1, allowing him to trigger Mystic Dispersion a lot.  This only improves with an Imbued Special 1 allowing him to Nullify all his opponent’s Buffs.
Assassin: The Assassin Mastery pairs very well with Dormammu’s Soul Bond. The very high ratio on a fully charged Soul Bond gives great returns from this mastery, and since the Soul Bond will take some time to fully charge, it’s likely to be ready when this Mastery kicks in.
Liquid Courage and Double Edge: I’m going to lump these two in together, since in this case they’re both doing pretty much the same thing: giving a large Attack boost, while Dormammu’s natural immunities prevent him from receiving their negative effects.```
Strengths
```Hyperion: A lot of Hyperion’s power comes from his repeated Power Gains, and Dormammu has several ways to deal with them. Also, the True Damage from both Soul Bond and Soul Leech allows him to bypass Hyperion’s high resistances.
Doctor Strange: Ahh the good Doctor, Dormammu’s long time nemesis. Now, this isn’t a super hard counter, but Dormammu is well equipped for this fight. He doesn’t rely on Buffs limiting the effect of Counterspell. He has a Nullify of his own to take down Doctor Strange’s period buffs, and once his Signature is unlocked he has a chance to Degenerate Doctor Strange each time he switches Buffs.
Cable: When stepping into the ring with Cable, Dormammu’s going to want to play the shutdown game. Cable can really get rolling when he triggers Power Gains, which in turn gives him more chances to trigger Regenerations, and more Power Gains. Dormammu has a couple of options to deal with this, either Nullifying them directly, or Power Locking and Draining him to prevent them having a chance to trigger.```
Weaknesses
```Electro: Electro is a tough contender for Dormammu, especially once he has access to his Signature Ability. Electro is happy to just sit on a full Power Bar for extra Critical Hits, never giving Dormammu a chance to build his Dark Energy, and hold Class Advantage for even more damage.
Captain America: Captain America is a great counter to Dormammu. He doesn’t have any Buffs to trigger, avoiding Soul Leech. Weakness provides a window in which Dormammu really doesn’t want to trigger the Soul Bond, and Class Advantage offsets Cap’s lower damage output.
Cyclops (Blue Team and New Xavier School): Cyclops has big Special Damage at his disposal, and doesn’t mind saving up for his Special 3, especially if he can get his combo up for the additional damage. Again, by saving up his Special Bar he can deny Dormammu much of his Dark Energy charge, and no buffs to trigger keep him safe from Soul Leech.```
