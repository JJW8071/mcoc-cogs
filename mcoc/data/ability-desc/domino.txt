Recommended Masteries
Offensively, the big numbers come from maximizing Critical Rate, Critical Damage, and Bleed damage. There are several Crit Masteries to choose from – all are great for Domino – and Deep Wounds to boost her Bleed damage. Stacking Attack Rating with Critical Rate and Critical Damage has a compounding effect on her Bleed damage, since her Bleeds have a chance to Crit as well. A Critical Bleed deals bonus Bleed damage equal to her Critical Damage at the time of the Bleed trigger.
It’s worth mentioning the benefits of Double Edge. The self-inflicted Bleed will end early and grant a bit of bonus Power in 50% of her fights. In every fight, it guarantees she’ll benefit from the damage bonus applied to Special 2 while Lucky.
Defensively – and don’t let the high damage potential fool you, she’s a highly effective defender as well – you’ll want to focus on Health, Block Proficiency, and Perfect Block Chance. The longer she’s alive, the more iterations through Lucky or Unlucky she’ll go through, and the more opportunities she’ll have to harm her opponent. It’s really that simple; however, fights against Domino aren’t ever over until the very end, as her Special 1 and 3 attacks both have the potential to accrue massive damage over the course of longer fights and surprise opponents with a last-ditch attack for high damage.
Coagulate and Willpower will also add even more anti-Bleed (and general all-around longevity) to grant Domino pseudo Bleed Immunity. In many cases – especially against Champion’s with more frequent, weaker Bleeds – Domino will profit with either Health, Power, or both when Bleed is inflicted upon her, making this pseudo-immunity better than actual immunity.

Strengths
She’s great when Bleed is present. Whether attacking or defending, if the enemy triggers Bleed, she’ll be in a good place. Conveniently, a lot of notorious Skill Champions rely on stacking Bleeds. Blade comes to mind.
Opponents that trigger abilities frequently, such as on every hit, will have a chance to fail on each of those events, and therefore trigger her Signature Critical Failure Ability often.

Weaknesses
Tech opponents, opponents that don’t Bleed or don’t inflict Bleed, and opponents with few abilities or reliably (100% trigger rates) abilities can walk all over Domino. Vision captures all three of these aspects.
