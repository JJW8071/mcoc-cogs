Recommended Masteries
```Enhanced & Extended Fury: Mordo relies on his Fury effects on his Heavy Attacks and Special 3 to do a lot of damage. Fury and attack enhancing masteries are a clear win for this Champion.
Recovery: His Special 3 has the chance to trigger Regeneration Buffs. Enhance it for maximum potential.
Parry & Stupefy: Players need to charge Heavy Attacks in order to get Fury stacks and Power. Stunning the opponent makes it an easier task.```

Strengths
```Magik, Magneto, Doctor Strange: Mystical Barrier Signature Ability allows him to drastically reduce incoming Energy Damage while he is Blocking. Champions that rely on Energy Debuffs or Attacks are going to have a hard time against Mordo.
Black Widow: Mordo’s astral form ensures that every ability properly activates, meaning you can use Parry against Black Widow in Alliance Wars.```

Weaknesses
```Stun immunity nodes: Mordo relies on Stuns to be able to charge Heavy Attacks to get Power and Fury stacks. Not being able to use Parry or his Special 1 to stun is a big disadvantage.```
