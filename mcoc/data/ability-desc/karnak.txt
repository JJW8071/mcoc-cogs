Special 1 - Distortion & Focus
Create distance, then focus to see the flaws.

• 100$ Chance to gain True Strike for 8.5 second, allowing this Champion to ignore Armor, Resistances, Auto-Block and all Evade effects.
• True Strike is a passive effect and cannot be nullified or removed.```
Special 2 - The Three Worlds

Recommended Masteries
```Lesser Cruelty / Cruelty: While in his Focused state, Karnak has one of the highest Critical Hit chances in the game. Grabbing one or both of these masteries can increase Karnak’s damage output by quite a bit.
Pierce / Pure Skill: With Karnak’s high Critical Hit rate, these two masteries will allow his regular attacks to pierce through more enemy Armor and take down heavily Armored foes quickly.
Dexterity: While Karnak has decent Physical Resistance, his base Armor rating is very low. As such, picking up Dexterity and dodging as many incoming attacks as possible will increase Karnak’s survivability and ensure he stays in the fight longer.```
Strengths
```Abomination, Ant-Man: In addition to having a class advantage over these Champions, Karnak reduces incoming Poison damage and duration while awakened and overcomes these Champions easily.
Electro, Spider-Man, Luke Cage: Karnak’s Special 3 Ability, Daze, allows him to reduce his opponent’s Defensive Ability Accuracy for a long duration, and bypass many of these Champions’ defensive triggers such as Static Shock and Evade.```
Weaknesses
```Magneto, Magneto (Marvel NOW!): In addition to a class disadvantage, both Magneto Champions also use energy damage during their base attacks and bypass Karnak’s only strong means of defense.```
