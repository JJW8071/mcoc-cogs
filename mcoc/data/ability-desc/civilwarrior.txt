Recommended Masteries
```Parry: One of Civil Warrior’s greatest strengths is his ability to apply a Heal Block with his Heavy attack. By triggering Parry then going into a Heavy Attack, Civil Warrior can keep these short Heal Block effects active throughout the fight.
Collar Tech: Civil Warrior’s ability to block his opponent’s incoming Special Damage, both from his Armor Up effects and his signature ability, allows him a great deal of survivability against opponents that rely on special damage. Grabbing this mastery further enhances this advantage by lowering the opponent’s Power Gain and reducing the number of Special Attacks overall.```
Strengths
```Deadpool, Wolverine, Wolverine (X-23), Ultron Prime: Civil Warrior’s ability to keep frequent Heal Block effects active allows him to deny these Champions their much needed Regeneration effects.
Cyclops, Storm: In addition to a class advantage, Civil Warrior’s ability to perform strong Power Drain effects denies these Champions their ability to perform their much needed special attacks. Additionally, his ability to reduce enemy Offensive Ability Accuracy means that these Champions cannot trigger their Armor Break and Stun effects.```
Weaknesses
```Iron Fist, Spider-Man (Symbiote), Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan): These Champions have a reliable way to strip away Civil Warrior’s Armor Up effects and do not rely on Offensive Ability Accuracy for their damage output as much as other Champions.```
