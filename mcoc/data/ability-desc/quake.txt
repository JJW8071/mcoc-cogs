Recommended Masteries
```Petrify, Stupefy & Pacify: Quake’s Aftershock ability Stuns opponents. Plus, reducing the opponent’s ability triggers with masteries, synergizes really well with her Concussion effect.
Courage, Glass Cannon & Greater Strength: All of Quake’s Aftershock and Earthquake effects are powerful and based on her attack rating. Therefore, increasing this attribute will give a greater advantage in fights. If you are skilled enough, Glass Cannon will also be effective because if the opponent is under the Concussion effect, their basic attacks are going to be Evaded.```
Strengths
```Power Gain Nodes: Skilled players are going to be able to take advantage of her Heavy Attack custom charging effect. She can charge her Heavy Attacks for as long as she wants and while charging, the opponent’s first Basic Attack are going to be Evaded because of the Concussion. This is great against Power nodes in AvA!
Ultron, Iron Man: Her Concussion effect has a pretty good chance to stop abilities from activating. If those two Champions are about to Regenerate, Special 2 will give them a Concussion!```
Weaknesses
```Black Widow, Elektra, Falcon: All those Champions can bypass her Evade ability while the Concussion effect is active.```
