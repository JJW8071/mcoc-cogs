Recommended Masteries
Recoil: Most of Sentry’s abilities are based around his Special Attacks and how they impact his damage output. Recoil is a good option to further increase his damage. In addition, his situational Regeneration on Special 3 will help mitigate damage taken from Recoil.
Extended/Enhanced Fury: When using Sentry, you’ll want to maintain the long-lasting Fury Buff gained from his Special 1 Attack. By keeping the Fury active and enhanced, Sentry will have a consistent boost to damage.
Glass Cannon: Sentry is all about increasing his Attack through his abilities. Glass Cannon is another way to boost Attack, and with his Signature Ability, he has some defenses to back the damage up.

Strengths
Dormammu: When entering into a long fight against Dormammu, Sentry is provided time to build up his damage. He’s able to gain Reality Warps, apply Fury, inflict Armor Breaks, and cycle through his different States to inflict a chunk of damage.
Magik: Sentry is able to deal large bursts of damage when his abilities align. This can be used to play around Magik’s Limbo. Sentry’s Special 3 Regeneration helps mitigate damage taken from Limbo.
M.O.D.O.K.: Sentry’s different States provide him with powerful Unblockable Attacks which help overcome M.O.D.O.K. and his auto-block ability.

Weaknesses
Green Goblin: All of Green Goblin’s ability are not good for Sentry. Sentry relies on Special Attacks, his Signature defense is disabled by Debuffs, and his focus is all about having high Attack. Green Goblin can counter all of Sentry’s abilities through his Special and Heavy Attacks, which all apply Power Drain, Poison, Incinerate, and Weakness.
Hela: Most of Sentry’s attacks are Physical based and Hela has a Passive that boosts her Physical Resistance. Sentry relies on maintaining a combo which is challenging when facing Hela’s Special Attacks.
Taskmaster: Taskmaster can reduce opponent’s Ability Accuracy which affects the overall damage output of Sentry. His Fury, Armor Break, and Signature Indestructible are all affected by the reduced Ability Accuracy.
