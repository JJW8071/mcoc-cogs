Special 1 - Objection!

Recommended Masteries
```Stupefy / Pacify / Petrify: She-Hulk has some of the longest Stun durations in the game, and amplifying her Stun effects can allow her to destroy her opponent’s when used correctly. Stupefy increases the duration of her Stun effects, while Pacify & Petrify deny them most of their defensive power while she wails on them.
Parry: As She-Hulk can remove Stun effects for large bursts of damage, giving her Parry can allow her to frequently get this damage boost when timed correctly.```
Strengths
```She-Hulk’s powerful Stun effects combined with her Pummel, allow smart players to play with strong combos. Instead of simply mashing attacks while the enemy is Stunned, try instead to mix it up with a couple of medium attacks, then switching into a Heavy attack for the Pummel boost.
She-Hulk’s strong passive effects from her signature ability allows her to fight with more impunity that other champions, as she can reliably bypass some of their strongest abilities.
She-Hulk fights very well against giant champions due to her increased Stun chance. Try bringing her in against Juggernaut and the Hulk to get those chain Stuns and Pummel effects going.```
Weaknesses
```As She-Hulk is reliant on her Stun effects for her damage output, she performs poorly against champions that can shrug off these effects (such as Groot), or champions that are Stun immune from local and linked nodes.```
