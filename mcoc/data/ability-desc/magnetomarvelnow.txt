Special 1 - Bloody Shrapnel
• 50% chance to inflict Bleed, dealing 200% of your Attack as direct damage over 10 Seconds.
• This has 2 potential triggers during the attack, allowing up to 2 stacks of Bleed.

Special 2 - Bleeding Fracture
• 50% chance to inflict Bleed, dealing 200% of your Attack as direct damage over 10 Seconds.
• This has 1 potential trigger during the attack, allowing up to 1 stack of Bleed.
• 100% chance to inflict Heal Block, preventing the target from recovering Health for 10 seconds.

Special 3 - Cold-Blooded Fusion
• 50% chance to inflict Bleed, dealing 200% of your Attack as direct damage over 10 Seconds.
• This has 1 potential trigger during the attack, allowing up to 1 stack of Bleed.
• 100% chance to inflict Heal Block, preventing the target from recovering Health for 10 seconds.
• 100% chance to Armor Break, removing enemy Armor and applying 10% Armor reduction for 8 seconds.

Signature Ability - Urgent Refraction
• Triggered when his health is low, Magneto bends a dense electromagnetic field around his body to create a personal force field, preventing him from losing more than 7% Health from a single source.
• Magneto triggers this ability any time he is below 60% health and it prevents him from losing more than 7% of his total health from any single attack.
• Due to the nature of how Special 3 attacks work, this also works on all enemy Special 3 attacks. This is because the Special 3 damage only calculates once, and is then split between the various attacks during the animation. Even multi hit attacks like Cyclops’s are considered to come from a “single source” of damage, and are reduced by Refraction.

Recommended Masteries
Willpower: Magneto can absorb powerful burst damage effects such as Special 3 attacks and Gamora’s Assassination, and his only weakness is stacked Bleed or Armor Break effects. Willpower turns those Bleed and Armor Break effects into boosted Armor and Health Regeneration.
Mutagenesis: Magneto can easily deal with burst damage via his Refraction ability, but is still weak to Bleed effects. Mutagenesis helps to remove this weakness.
Glass Cannon: The reduced Health caused by Glass Cannon allows Magneto to trigger his Refraction more easily, and the extra damage provided adds massive power to his already strong Special Attacks.

Strengths
Magneto’s specialty lies in fighting opponents who can deal massive burst damage, either from Special 3 attacks or single burst effects such as Gamora’s Assassination ability.
The frequency of Heal Block on Bleeding Fracture (Special 2) and Cold-Blooded Fusion (Special 3) allows Magneto to more easily deal with regenerating targets, such as Wolverine or Superior Iron man.
The consistent Bleed effects from all Special Attacks allows Magneto to easily take down Armor or Physical Resistant champions such as Rhino or Juggernaut.

Weaknesses
Magneto’s reliance on Bleed effects for damage output leave him with fewer tools to deal with non-bleeding characters such as Vision or Ultron.
Most of Magneto’s power comes from his Special Attacks, and any effect that can deny him his Special Meter are extra powerful. Effects such as Power Lock, Power Burn, or Power Drain deny him access to the majority of his damage and utility.
