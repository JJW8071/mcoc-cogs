Recommended Masteries
```• Willpower: Magneto can absorb powerful burst damage effects such as Special 3 attacks and Gamora’s Assassination, and his only weakness is stacked Bleed or Armor Break effects. Willpower turns those Bleed and Armor Break effects into boosted Armor and Health Regeneration.
• Mutagenesis: Magneto can easily deal with burst damage via his Refraction ability, but is still weak to Bleed effects. Mutagenesis helps to remove this weakness.
• Glass Cannon: The reduced Health caused by Glass Cannon allows Magneto to trigger his Refraction more easily, and the extra damage provided adds massive power to his already strong Special Attacks.```

Strengths
```• Magneto’s specialty lies in fighting opponents who can deal massive burst damage, either from Special 3 attacks or single burst effects such as Gamora’s Assassination ability.
• The frequency of Heal Block on Bleeding Fracture (Special 2) and Cold-Blooded Fusion (Special 3) allows Magneto to more easily deal with regenerating targets, such as Wolverine or Superior Iron man.
• The consistent Bleed effects from all Special Attacks allows Magneto to easily take down Armor or Physical Resistant champions such as Rhino or Juggernaut.```

Weaknesses
```• Magneto’s reliance on Bleed effects for damage output leave him with fewer tools to deal with non-bleeding characters such as Vision or Ultron.
• Most of Magneto’s power comes from his Special Attacks, and any effect that can deny him his Special Meter are extra powerful. Effects such as Power Lock, Power Burn, or Power Drain deny him access to the majority of his damage and utility.```
