All stats based on 4-Star, Rank 5, Level 50, Signature Level 99

Basic Abilities: Evade, Poise, Stun, Lightning Arc, Ensnare

When Attacked - Evade
```• Spider-Man’s burgeoning Spider-Sense grants him a Passive 3% chance to Evade an incoming attack.```
Stark Tech AI
```• Against Special Attacks the Stark AI warns Spider-Man of incoming danger and increases his Evade chance by a flat +60%.
• If Spider-Man is struck by a Cosmic Champion or is struck by a Heavy Attack the Stark AI shuts down for 10 seconds while it Reboots and is completely inactive during that time.```
Smack-Talk
```• Each time Spider-Man Evades an attack or uses the Dexterity Mastery, he gains a charge of Poise. Cooldown: 0.80 Seconds.
• Each charge of Poise grants 256.6 Attack rating.
• If Spider-Man lands 5 uninterrupted attacks, he converts a Poise charge into a Taunt Debuff on the opponent for 3 seconds. Taunt lasts 50% longer against Villain Champions.
• Dodging back and allowing Spider-Man to idle for 1 second allows him to smack-talk his opponent and refresh an active Taunt.
• Opponents that are Taunted have their Attack reduced by 40% and have a 70% higher chance to activate a Special Attack.```
Heavy Attacks - Power Drain
```• An EMP webshot drains 45% of the opponent’s Power Meter. Cooldown: 30 seconds.```

Special 1 - Spider Strike
Uppercut. Place webs. Launch self at criminal. No problem. Just like back in Queens…but what about the name?
```• 50% chance to Stun the opponent for 2 seconds. The chance is increased by 100% if the Stark AI is active.```
Special 2 - Stick & Shock
Electric webshots! Thwip thwip, zap, sizzle!
```• Electric webshots have a 70% chance to Shock the opponent, dealing 1154.7 Energy Damage over 6.50 seconds. These Shock effects are overcharged and deal double damage to Robot Champions.```
Special 3 - Whatever a Spider Can…
Awesome entrance. Check. Blast the opponent with webshots. Got it. Launch opponent into wall. Nailed it. Strike amazing hero pose…good enough.
```• 100% chance to Ensnare the opponent for 18 seconds. Ensnared Champions suffer 30% reduced Ability Accuracy and cannot trigger Passive Evade effects.```

Recommended Masteries
```Dexterity: Spider-Man (Stark Enhanced) gains Poise charges when successfully using Dexterity, granting him additional Attack Rating and enabling him to Taunt the opponent.
Physical Resistance & Block Proficiency: Spider-Man (Stark Enhanced) is able to Evade Special Attacks reliably, adding Block Proficiency and Physical Resistance to overall increase his durability will make Spider-Man a hard Champion to defeat.```

Strengths
```The new “Taunt” mechanic will allow players to easily bait Special Attacks in order to avoid being hit by the opponent’s unblockable third Special Attack.```

Weaknesses
```Karnak & Hyperion: Karnak is able to completely negate Spider-Man’s Evasiveness and Hyperion is able to deactivate the Stark AI when attacking, because of his Cosmic Class Advantage.```
