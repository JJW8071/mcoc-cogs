Bleed - All Special Attacks
• 94% Chance to inflict Bleed, dealing 225% of your Attack as direct damage over 5 seconds.
• Each Special Attack only has 1 potential Bleed trigger on the last hit of the attack.

Special 1 - Symbiotic Smack
• Om Nom
• The Symbiote has a 85% chance to steal an enemy beneficial effect from the opponent and feed it to Deadpool to trigger his Healing Factor, recovering 9.5% Health over 7 seconds.
• The Regeneration trigger will only occur if a Buff is successfully eaten.

Special 2-  Sword Spin: XL Edition
• Deadpool, with the help of his new symbiote friend, has found his carbonadium sword, which places a Heal Block on the opponent for 8.5 seconds.
• Allowing Deadpool to finish his sweet dance moves after his attack boosts his confidence and grants 15% increased Critical Hit Rate for 6.5 seconds.
• If you interrupt Venompool’s sweet dance moves at the end of his Special 2 animation, you won’t gain the increased Critical Hit Rate.

Special 3-  Ssssssave Me!
• Any Bleed effect triggered lasts 38% longer than normal.

Signature Ability - Continuity Memory
• Every 6 seconds, the symbiote known as Venom has a (20 - 45%) chance to access Deadpool’s unique memory and grant him a random beneficial effect for a short time...even if he never actually had that effect in the past...
• These effects range from Armor Up to Regeneration, with other stranger abilities all lumped in as well. Below are just a few of the possible benefits:
• Unstoppable for 3 seconds.
• Static Shock for 7 seconds.
• Indestructible for 3.5 seconds.
• A Luck Buff that affects both champions’ Ability Accuracy. Venompool’s gets better while his opponent’s gets worse.
• ALL THE ARMOR! *It’s actually called that in game
• And others!

Recommended Masteries
Recovery: As Venompool has a fairly reliable Regeneration trigger in his Om Nom ability, he can frequently consume enemy Buffs to regularly regain health. Recovery increases this amount and adds extra survivability.
Pierce / Cruelty: Venompool’s Dance Break ability gives him a very reliable Critical Hit Chance buff, allowing him to score reliable Critical Hits after a Special 2 Attack. Buffing the Critical Damage Output allows him to jack up his damage output during this time, especially when combined with a powerful Bleed and Heal Block ability against annoying Regeneration champions.

Strengths
Venompool is a beast at destroying champions that rely on Buffs, as he can frequently strip them away and regenerate whenever they activate them.
Venompool also has one of the strongest Bleed effects in the game, allowing him to easily take on Armored champions such as Iron Man, Hulkbuster, and Rhino.
By utilizing his abilities for the right match-ups, Venompool can overcome powerful regeneration effects, either by consuming them with Om Nom, or by using the Heal Block / Bleed combo on his Special 2.

Weaknesses
The majority of Venompool’s damage output comes from his powerful Bleed triggers, and as a result, he performs very poorly against Bleed Immune champions.
