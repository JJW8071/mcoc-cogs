A sweet sword spinny attack, except now the swords are gigantic. Pause for sick dance moves!
```• Deadpool, with the help of his new symbiote friend, has found his carbonadium sword, which places a Heal Block on the opponent for 9.50 seconds.

Recommended Masteries
```Recovery: As Venompool has a fairly reliable Regeneration trigger in his Om Nom ability, he can frequently consume enemy Buffs to regularly regain health. Recovery increases this amount and adds extra survivability.
Pierce / Cruelty: Venompool’s Dance Break ability gives him a very reliable Critical Hit Chance buff, allowing him to score reliable Critical Hits after a Special 2 Attack. Buffing the Critical Damage Output allows him to jack up his damage output during this time, especially when combined with a powerful Bleed and Heal Block ability against annoying Regeneration champions.```

Strengths
```Venompool is a beast at destroying champions that rely on Buffs, as he can frequently strip them away and regenerate whenever they activate them.
Venompool also has one of the strongest Bleed effects in the game, allowing him to easily take on Armored champions such as Iron Man, Hulkbuster, and Rhino.
By utilizing his abilities for the right match-ups, Venompool can overcome powerful regeneration effects, either by consuming them with Om Nom, or by using the Heal Block / Bleed combo on his Special 2.```

Weaknesses
```The majority of Venompool’s damage output comes from his powerful Bleed triggers, and as a result, he performs very poorly against Bleed Immune champions.```
