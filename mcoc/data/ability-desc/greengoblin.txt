• Pumpkin Bomb: 85% chance to Poison.```
Special 3 - Goblin King’s Blitz

```• Pumpkin Bombs: 40% chance to inflict Power Drain, Weakness, Incinerate and Poison.```

Recommended Masteries
```• Collar Tech: Green Goblin’s Cunning effect also works against all Power Generation sources including Mystic Dispersion and Vision’s Power Gain when awakened. Getting this mastery will provide additional power denial, plus using that with his Special 1 Power Drain will be immensely powerful.
• Glass Cannon: Green Goblin can deal a lot of damage through his Special 2 and Special 3 Attack. Experienced players will want to try this combo to unleash the maximum potential of his Oscorp Weaponry Signature Ability.```

Strengths
```• Alliance Wars Defense: It can be very hard to avoid getting hit by Green Goblin’s Special 2 Attack. Try placing him on Nodes that enhance the strength of his Special 2 that should provide you some defender kills in Alliance Wars.
• Denying opponent’s from getting Power: One of Green Goblin’s exclusive abilities is that he can lower the amount of Power Gained if you take advantage of his Cunning, that means it will work against Champions who have Power Gain abilities like Mordo, Vision and Mystic Heroes equipped with Mystic Dispersion.```

Weaknesses
```• It can be hard to control his Cunning and Madness, adjusting to this mechanic will take time so if players are not used to it, the inability to control his personalities can become Green Goblins weaknesses.```
