Recommended Masteries
Petrify & Pacify: When going for his Special 3, Loki Curses the opponent and deals damage over time while also stealing their Buffs. When the opponent is Cursed, basic attacks have a chance to inflict Stun and heavy attacks renews the duration of the Curse. So if you are skilled enough, you can keep the enemy cursed for the entire duration of the fight.
Despair: Curse is a Debuff, add in Despair mastery to crush opponents even more by reducing their Regeneration effects.
Courage & Greater Strength: Loki’s Special 2 and Special 3 deals additional ability damage, maximizing your attack is a clear and simple choice.

Strengths
Ultron, Venom or Thor: Opponents that heavily rely on Buffs are going to get hard-countered by Loki.
Doctor Strange or Magneto: Loki’s resistance to Energy attacks is pretty strong, making him a strong competitor when going against opponents that rely on it.

Weaknesses
Hulk or Black Panther: Opponents that rely on pure attack stats and debuffs to deal damage are going to excel against Loki. He is weaker against physical attacks, despite still having a lot of health.
