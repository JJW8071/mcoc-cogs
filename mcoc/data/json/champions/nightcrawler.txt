Recommended Masteries
Precision: As Nightcrawler’s Deep Wound, and by extension his Signature Ability, rely on striking with consistent Critical Hits, grabbing this mastery can increase his damage output by a large amount.
Cruelty: While in his Swashbuckling Mode, Nightcrawler gets a fairly large boost to his Critical Hit Chance. Increasing his Critical Damage can allow this Mode to grant even larger damage boosts.
Mutagenesis / Block Proficiency: Outside of his ability to Evade incoming damage, either through his passive Neyaphem Mode or through his Bamf skill, Nightcrawler has poor defenses. Grabbing these masteries can increase his survivability for the rare occasions when he gets struck.

Strong Match-Ups
Daredevil, Punisher, Black Panther, Crossbones: In addition to a class advantage, Nightcrawler will have an easier time Evading these Champions’ attacks as they primarily deal Physical Damage.
Superior Iron Man, Rhino, Agent Venom: Nightcrawler’s Deep Wound ability can bypass the Armor, Physical Resist and Tenacity of these Champions to deal extra bursts of damage throughout the fight.

Weak Match-Ups
Vision, Vision (Age of Ultron), Ultron: In addition to a class advantage, these Champions are immune to Bleed and Deep Wound, denying Nightcrawler much of his damage output.
