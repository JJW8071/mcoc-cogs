Signature Ability – Unyielding Might

Recommended Masteries
Recovery & Enhanced Fury: King Groot is constantly triggering Fury and Regeneration Buffs throughout the fight. He will almost always have one or the other if he’s awakened. Grabbing these two masteries will empower both of these effects, allowing King Groot to put in some extra hurt and recover more lost health.
Inequity: Through the use of his permanent Armor Break effects, King Groot can make good use of the inequity Mastery, especially for longer fights. By launching several Armor Breaks, King Groot can not only increase his damage output, but he can also weaken his opponent and give himself more time in the fight to use his regeneration effects.

Strong Match-Ups
Iron Man, Iron Patriot: In addition to a class advantage, King Groot has access to frequent Armor Break effects to counter these Champions’ Armor Up Buffs. Through careful timing, King Groot can also plant 2 poison effects on these Champions as they’re about to hit their Arc Overload, thus weakening their regeneration effects.
Black Panther, Deadpool (X-Force), Wolverine: These Champions are very reliant on consistent Bleed effects for their damage output, which King Groot is immune to. They also lack the ability to deal with either King Groot’s Fury or Regeneration Buffs, giving him the advantage the longer the fight goes on.
Daredevil, Captain America (WWII): These Champions rely on very few but strong Debuffs during combat, which King Groot can easily shrug off. Additionally, these Champions lack any means of protecting themselves from King Groot’s Armor Break and Poison Debuffs.

Weak Match-Ups
Strange, The Hood, Dormammu: In addition to a class advantage, these Champions have reliable and powerful nullifying effects, allowing them to rip down King Groot’s Fury and Regeneration Buffs and deny him the majority of his strength.
