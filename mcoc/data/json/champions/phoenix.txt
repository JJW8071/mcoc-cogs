Recommended Masteries
Enhanced Fury: The Phoenix Force passive ability allows the Phoenix to create lots of fury buffs. Increasing the effect of each of these can have a large impact on her damage potential.
Courage: Similar to Enhanced Fury, increasing Phoenix’s attack translates to a large damage increase, and her Signature Ability makes playing around at low HP values a little less dangerous.
Inequity: When playing for sustained damaged, the Phoenix can keep herself in the Empowered zone for quite a while, gaining a guaranteed incinerate on hit. These stack up fast, and can make a difference for the Phoenix who lacks powerful defensive tools beyond her Signature Ability.

Strengths
Iron Man, Iron Patriot, Superior Iron Man: In addition to Class Advantage (against most of them) Phoenix can Armor Break to counter their Armor Ups, and her massive burst damage allows her to blow right through their Overload Regens.
Captain America, Captain America (WW2): Captain America lacks any way to disrupt Phoenix’s core Fury loop, allowing Phoenix to stay Empowered for longer. This allows Phoenix to keep him Incinerated lowering his Block Proficiency and removing Perfect Block.

Weaknesses
Ronan: Before gaining his Signature Ability, Edict, Ronan’s ability to convert Fury to Weakness helps him a little against Phoenix. However once his Edict ability kicks in, Phoenix will have to be very careful as she will almost always have many stacks of Fury to trigger the full damage and stun duration bonus.
Doctor Strange: Few Champions have the ability to interfere with Phoenix’s core Fury building loop like Doctor Strange. Nullify, Counterspell, Fate Seal all have the ability to throw Phoenix’s timing out, leaving her struggling to do damage!
