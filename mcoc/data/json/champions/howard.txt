Signature Ability – MASH ALL THE BUTTONS!
• When Howard is brought below 60% and 30% Max Health, he frantically mashes buttons on the Loader console. This has a (38 – 87%) chance to trigger a Self Repair, healing 20% Max Health, or a Thunderquack, dealing 135% of his Attack as Energy Damage. Both effects last 7 seconds and are interrupted if Howard is Stunned.

Recommended Masteries
Resonate: For long duration fights, Howard has the ability to launch multiple Special 1 attacks and reduce his opponent’s attack by 24%. Combine this with the Weakness effect caused by Resonate and Howard gains much higher survivability.
Precision: While using the Catalyst Absorber on his Special 3, Howard gains powerful effects on his Critical Hits. Grabbing this Mastery will allow Howard to trigger these effects more often for added benefit.

Strengths
Wolverine, Wolverine (X-23), Deadpool: In addition to a class advantage, Howard can permanently reduce these Champions’ Regeneration Rate with his Special 1 or gain his own Regeneration effect with his Special 3.
Hulk, Captain America, Colossus: These Champions rely on raw damage to take down opponents and do not have access to Armor Break. Howard’s high Armor Rating protects him very well against this type of opponent.
Doctor Strange, Loki: These Champions have low Physical Resistance and Howard’s consistent Fury effects from Quack  Fu allows his basic attacks to easily overpower these Champions.

Weaknesses
Ronan: Ronan’s ability to convert Armor Up into Armor Breaks, combined with his increased Stun duration against buffed opponents allows him to quickly bring Howard down.
Iron Fist, Spider-Man (Symbiote): These Champions can regularly apply Armor Break effects to bring down the ISO-Loader’s Armor effects and leave Howard with little in the way of defenses.
