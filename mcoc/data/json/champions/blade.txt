Recommended Masteries
Deep Wounds: Blade’s Well Timed Block and Special 2 Attacks can inflict a lot of short duration Bleeds and Deep Wounds will greatly enhance their damage.
Recovery: Blade’s Signature Ability and Recovery will allow him to regain more Health while still paying the same amount of Power per second.
Courage: Blade can precisely control the amount of Health he has while below 70% Health, making it easier to stay just below the 50% Health range and benefiting from Courage’s Attack Rating increase.

Strong Match-Ups
Magik: Blade’s Danger Sense will always activate against Dimensional Beings, reducing their opponent’s Ability Accuracy while also granting Blade a huge attack increase. This means Magik’s Limbo will activate less frequently in a fight.
Archangel: Blade is able to reduce the potency and duration of Debuffs based on how much Power he has, making it a great counter against Champions that rely heavily on Debuffs in order to inflict most of their damage.
Mystic Champions and Villain Champions: Blade’s Synergies allows him to activate Danger Sense against all Mystic and Villain Champions in The Contest. Watch out for your opponent’s Champion Tags!

Weak Match-Ups
Dormammu and Iceman: Any opponents that are immune to Bleed will greatly reduce Blade’s damage output and make him unable to gain Power when nearby Bleeding opponents.
Civil Warrior and Scarlet Witch: Heal Block will neutralize Blade’s Signature Ability Regeneration aspect but Blade will still pay the Power cost.
