Mobile Terms.

Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after e-mail is sent, unless the sending party is notified that the e-mail address is invalid.

The failure of Kabam to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Kabam.\n\n32. Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver. \n\nTHIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO PLAYERS IN THE US AND CANADA. \n\nBefore bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support team or try to find a resolution on one of our forums. Most disputes can be resolved that way. \n\nWe Both Agree to Arbitrate . If we can’t resolve our dispute through Customer Service or on our forums, you and Kabam agree to resolve any claims relating to the Terms through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory. \n\nEither of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court. \n\nIn addition, if you or Kabam brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You or Kabam may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing. \n\nNo Class Actions . We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. That means: (a) neither you nor Kabam can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action; (b) an arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this); (c) an arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other Kabam users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users. If a court decides that this subsection on \"No Class Actions\" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 32 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver) will be null and void, but, the rest of the Terms will still apply. \n\nThe Arbitration Process . Any disputes between you and Kabam relating to the Website or the Services that involve a claim of less than US$10,000 must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. In addition, you and Kabam agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any disputes between you and Kabam relating to the Website or the Services that involve a claim of less than US$10,000 must be resolved in accordance with the AAA’s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person. \n\n33. Governing Law. The Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without regards to its principles of conflicts of law that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, and shall be considered to have been made and accepted in the State of California.\n\n34. Jurisdiction for Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration. If the Agreement to Arbitrate is determined to be invalid or unenforceable or for any disputes that do not qualify for arbitration, the dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in San Francisco, California. You hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.\n\n35. Severability. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\n\n36. Assignment. The Terms and any related rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Kabam’s prior written consent, but may be assigned by Kabam freely without restriction.\n\n37. Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and Kabam relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter.\n\n38. Miscellaneous. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by the Terms. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. Kabam’s performance of the Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Terms is in derogation of Kabam’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Websites, Services, including without limitation those available through Third Party Platforms, and any information provided to or gathered by Kabam with respect to such use(s). A printed version of the Terms and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The parties agree that all correspondence relating to the Terms must be written in the English language.
